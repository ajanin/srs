# For each entry X in srs_go_data_directories, there must be an entry
# srs_go_data_path_X in this section, which controls where the
# physical directories are created. They must point to separate
# directories. Directories will be created automatically under
# these directories by appending $USER/srs-go/$HASH, where
# $USER is the user log in name and $HASH is a pseudo random
# string.
#
# You can use $$USER in the strings below and it will be replaced
# by the user's log in name.
