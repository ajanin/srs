# $USER is replaced with the current user (from the environment
# variable), $PROG is replaced by the program name (typically srs-go),
# $HASH is a hash code of the template, the top directory, and the
# user, $STEP is the path to the current step, $TOP is the experiment
# directory, and $SYS is replaced with sysdir_name (usually the
# same as $PROG but uppercase). Note that srs-go itself does these
# expansions, so we need $$ in the config file so srs-go sees just a
# single $.
