This directory contains an extract from the Swordfish directories of various documents specifically about SRS (the System for Running Systems).

It's probably best to start with the tutorials.

Note that SRS was mostly used in the context of the ICSI Swordfish project, which was funded under the IARPA Babel program. There are plenty of remnants of its heritage.

Currently, SRS is not heavily used and has seen little additional development. The code was released under a BSD license, and is available upon request (janin@icsi.berkeley.edu).
