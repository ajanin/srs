This document outlines some of the more advanced features of srs-go
in more detail. It assumes you have already read and understood
srs-go-tutorial.txt, srs-config-tutorial.txt, and environment.txt.

Details on Restart Logic

The purpose of srs-go -restart is to rerun an experiment with mostly the same
settings as a previous run. If you want to change most or all of the
settings, you should probably do a fresh run from the template.

When you specify -restart, srs-go basically ignores the DONE flags
that steps produce when they complete successfully (return zero status
for file steps and have all substeps succeed for directory steps).
This means that all steps will execute again. This can sometimes have
unexpected side effects depending on how steps are written. Some
things to watch for:

1). Steps that execute code conditioned on the existence of files.
It is usually best for step writers to avoid this, since a basic
philosophy of srs-go is that file steps either succeed or fail;
partial success isn't supported.

2). Steps that conditionally write output config files. After a step
completes execution, srs-go checks if there's an output config
file. If there isn't, it will generate the default one that simply
includes the input config file. Note that there are two reasons why an
input config file might exist: a) The step wrote it; b) A *previous*
run of the step wrote it. Srs-go does NOT delete previous config files
even if you specify -restart since the whole point of -restart rather
than running a new experiment is to duplicate previous settings.
