"To Do" for srs-go.

More test cases for conditional steps.
Fix conditional steps so that DEFAULT is called if variable is undefined.

Add outconfig for directory steps.

Right now, copying from the template to dir requires dir be empty.
This should be changed so you can preset something in dir. If so,
we'll have to check for SRS-GO to see if it's been run before.
Maybe provide a -overwrite flag?

Move curstep to State

Perhaps data directories should be created when the template is
copied rather than when a directory step is executed? This may
be a problem for steps that change templates dynamically.

Step cleanup when -clean is called?
