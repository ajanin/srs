# Attempt to clean up orphan data directories from srs-go.
#
# A directory is an orphan if it is empty, or if
# it contains a symbolic link srs-go-dir that links
# to a directory that doesn't exist.
#
# This is all hand-coded to LLNL, and should probably use
# the srs system instead (which will require re-thinking
# how the templates for the data directories work).
#
# This will almost certainly do horrible things if
# a SRS run is in progress.
