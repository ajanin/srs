# This config file is read by srs-go and should hold variables
# that control where srs-go creates data directories.
#
# This config file demonstrates one option if your site doesn't have
# local or ttmp style disks. It uses the user's home directory for
# storage, and therefore local isn't really local and ttmp isn't
# really ttmp.
#
# See also srs-go.config.vm for another option if your site doesn't
# have local or ttmp style disk.

# The following section controls how the data directories are
# created.

# List of links created under the data directory
srs_go_data_directories scratch_local_ttmp scratch_ttmp scratch

# For each entry X in srs_go_data_directories, there must be an entry
# srs_go_data_path_X in this section, which controls where the
# physical directories are created. They must point to separate
# directories. Directories will be created automatically under
# these directories by appending $USER/srs-go/$HASH, where
# $USER is the user log in name and $HASH is a pseudo random
# string.
#
# You can use $$USER in the strings below and it will be replaced
# by the user's log in name.
