"To Do" for srs-go-parallel

Support multiple config files.

Rethink what to do if dest directory is not empty. If there are no failed tasks, overwrite should be fine. -overwrite to clean first?

When running -cleandata, batch up all the tasks per machine
and execute in one call. Probably use pdsh.

Unify subdirectory code and make it more general (e.g. read
template from config file).

Check that I use "task" and "batch" consistently
