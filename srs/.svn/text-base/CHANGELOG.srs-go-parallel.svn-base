Change log for srs-go-parallel

Initial Version: Mar 27, 2012 Adam Janin

Version 0.2 April 13, 2012 Adam Janin (lots of ideas from Arlo)
 Argument to -config is evaluated relative to current directory
rather than task directory. It is also optional.
 It is now an error if -dir is not empty unless -clean* is used.
 Directory structure under -dir reorganized.
 Failed tasks are listed as symbolic links under failed_tasks
to the tasks/task000i directory.
 Added -preserve option which may be:
  none     Delete all task directories when they exit.
  errors   Delete task directories if task returns exit code 0
  all      Do not delete task directories
This does NOT effect the links under failed_tasks directly,
though it does mean they might link to non-existent directories.

May 18, 2012 Adam Janin
No new version number. Added -attr which just gets added to
the run-command arguments.

Feb 27, 2012 Adam Janin
No new version number. Remove -attr scratch_tmp requirement.

Oct 23, 2013 Adam Janin
Added new option -overwrite which will blow away any
existing experiment directory.
