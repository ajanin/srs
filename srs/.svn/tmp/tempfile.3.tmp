Initial version: Feb 21, 2012 Adam Janin

Version 0.2, April 12, 2012 Adam Janin
 Modified so that the default config file is /dev/null
and previous values of -config and extraconfig are ignored.
The only time a previous value is used is -template can
be omitted, and it will be recovered from a previous run.
 MASTER.config is now a dump of all the variables from -config
and extraconfig rather than extraconfig followed by INCLUDE.
I think this is better for achiving the actual experiment.
If you want to repeat a previous run with the same config,
you can do e.g. -config exp01/SRS-GO/config/MASTER.config

Version 0.3, Jan 14, 2013 Adam Janin
 Files in the template starting with . or # or ending with ~
are not copied.
 Time stamps in log output.
 Multiple -config arguments are now supported.
 Various srs-go config variables are now read from the -config
files and from the command line.
 Redesign of how data directories and their templates work. Now, the
config variable srs_go_data_directories should be a space separated
list of names of directories that will get created (as links) under
srs_go_datapath_template (e.g. SRS-GO/data). For each entry X, there
must be an entry srs_go_data_template_X that defines where the
physical directory will be created.
 Added -timeout <float>. If a file step takes more than <float>
seconds to complete, it will be killed and is considered failed.
 Added -retries <N>. If a file step fails, it will be tried <N> times.

Version 0.31, Feb 17, 2013 Adam Janin
 Changed -retries/-timeout logic to use environment variables
so that indirect calls to srs-go will abide by -retries/-timeout
unless they are explicitly specified on the command line by
the indirect call to srs-go.
 Fixed minor bug with log file naming where .tryN was created
even if with -retries 0.
 Subprocess calls to the steps are a bit more bullet-proof.
 If steps contain non-ascii, print an error and die.
 The default output config file is now always written.

Version 0.32, Feb 28, 2013 Adam Janin
 Fixed logic of seen_not_done to allow directory steps to
continue in the middle (rather than an entire directory
step being restarted).

######################################################################
Version 0.4, Oct 11 2013, Adam Janin

Fixed -from logic so that config files are linked.

Fixed a bug in the -from/-to/-restart interaction.

Data directories in the config file are now specified by a prefix
rather than with a full template. $USER/$PROG/$HASH/$STEP is appended
to generate the full path.

Removed the ability to override logpath_template,
datapath_template, and configpath_template because it would cause
huge confusion if anybody actually ever did that.

Config files are now loaded in the following order:
 1) Command line "extra config" arguments
 2) Config files specified by -config command line
 3) Files from the colon separated list in the environment variable
$SRS_GO_CONFIG (e.g. setenv SRS_GO_CONFIG /u/janin/rats.srs-go.config)
 4) SCRIPTDIR/srs-go.config, where SCRIPTDIR is the directory where
the script srs-go lives.

All variables from all of the above config files are now included in
MASTER.config.

Rearranged logic of when config variables are loaded.

The template can now be specified either using the -template argument
or the config variable srs_go_template. The command line -template
argument overrides the config variable.

For reasons I don't quite understand, the stdout and stderr log files
don't seem to get closed immediately when timeouts occur, which can cause
oddness under NFS. The code now will sleep for 5 seconds if a timeout
occurs in the hope that NFS will catch up.

Changed ad-hoc tests to use GNU Autotest.

-dir is now a required argument rather than defaulting to the current
directory.

Version 0.5

10/12/13 Adam Janin

Fixed a bug where command line vars could not be used in macros
in later configs.

10/18/13 Adam Janin

Made it so that SRS-GO directories are not copied if they're in
a template. This allows you to use an existing run as a template.

Added clearer error message if it can't find the experiment directory.

Fixed so directory step's SRS-GO directories aren't copied either.

10/27/13 Adam Janin

Added support for switch.

Empty file steps are now legal.
