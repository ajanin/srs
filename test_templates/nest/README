This template is for testing srs-go.

Each step is a symbolic link to testcmd.sh, which just echos the 
name of the command.

If you set the config variable failsteps, a step will fail if
the name of the command occurs anywhere in failsteps.

For example, if there's a command called step010.step030 and failsteps
is set to "step010.step020,step010.step030" then step010.step030 will
print an error message and fail.

All the steps are named for the REVERSE path they follow from the
root. For example, step010.step030.step020 is under the top level as
./step020/step030.step020/step010.step030.step020
