Test of retries for both failure and timeouts.

The template writes a "3" to a temp file in step010.init.

In step020.fail3times, the number is read from the temp file,
decremented, and written back to the temp file.

If the count reaches 0, the step fails.

In other words, if step020.fail3times is called 4 times, the final time
will succeed.

step040.timeout3times also reads and decrements a temp file, but
it will simply sleep for 10 seconds if the count is above 3 and
not sleep otherwise.
