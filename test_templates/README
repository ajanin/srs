This directory holds various test of srs-go.

To run the tests, just run ./testsuite.

If you modify testsuite.at (the source code for the tests), you can
regenerate testsuite by running:

autom4te -l autotest testsuite.at -o testsuite

This requires that GNU autotest (part of GNU automake) is installed.
