This directory contains the System for Running Systems (SRS), a set of
tools built under the Swordfish project at ICSI to support the IARPA
Babel program.

Note that this is an early BETA release of SRS. There are known bugs,
missing features, and the install process is somewhat involved.

Contact Adam Janin <janin@icsi.berkeley.edu> if you have questions
or comments.
